# Artificial Intelligence with Python: Notes & Projects
_By Joshua Oh_

This repository serves as a personal documentation of my notes, learnings, and experiments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Python. It covers key concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations in Machine Learning (ML) and other AI techniques.

Additionally, I’ve included several hands-on projects developed during my free time, showcasing applications of ML models, neural networks, and other AI approaches. These projects reflect my exploration of real-world problem-solving using Python’s AI/ML ecosystem.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
