# Artificial Intelligence with Python: Notes & Projects
_By Joshua Oh_

This repository serves as my personal documentation of notes, learnings, and experiments in **Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Python**. It covers:

- Key concepts and algorithms  
- Practical implementations in Machine Learning (ML)  
- Various AI techniques and approaches  

I've also included **hands-on projects** developed during my free time, showcasing applications of:
- ML models  
- Neural networks  
- Other AI approaches  

These projects demonstrate real-world problem-solving using Python's AI/ML ecosystem.  

*Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!*
