## Fuzzy Logic vs Boolean(Conventional Logic)

### Boolean or Conventional Logic 
+ In **boolean or conventional logic**, a **value** is defined as the boundary to distinguish **'Tall'** and **'Short'**
+ For example,
```plaintext
Boundary is 180 cm for tall guy. Samuel is 179 cm therefore he is a short guy
```
+ In traditional **boolean logic**, variables may take on only true or false values (1 or 0)
