# Calculus 1
Python is a powerful tool for performing calculus operations, both symbolically (using libraries like SymPy) and numerically (using libraries like NumPy and SciPy).

!!! Info

    **Symbolic Calculus with SymPy:**

    SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics that can perform calculus operations like differentiation, integration, limits, and series expansions. To install the SymPy module:

    ```py
    pip install sympy
    ```

    **Numerical Calculus with NumPy/SciPy:**

    For numerical computations, we can use NumPy and SciPy. To install the modules:

    ```py
    pip install numpy scipy
    ```
